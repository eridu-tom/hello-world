# hello-world
Just the usual learning, messing around and breaking things.

      When you close your eyes in a dream, you wake up...
      
I am Tom Burke, learning to code better websites and mobile apps.
        (I have ideas, now I need to ask "how?")
   
  Big fan of Linux and FOSS, hope to be able to contribute to or start a FOSS project eventually.
  
  Biology BSc from the University of Kent, studied prion proteins as dissertation.
  Interest in Biology - especially Neuroscience, Endocrinology, Immunology, signal cascades and protein-protein, protein-smallmolecule interactions.
    I believe that one of the biggest breakthroughs in all of human development, which will occur in this century, will be the gradual fusion of Biology's understated excquisite capability with our comparatively-crude but understood and highly flexible modern electronic capability. It will not be electronics giving the biologics "super-powers" - as is oft portrayed - instead it shall be the biologic components embuing the electronic components with "super-powers"! For every ability to prescisely interact with the nanoscale, we have aquired few - often extremely large, expensive and impractical, requiring absolute genius to design (like early computers). Yet for every detection of any molecule, large or small, biology has developed a way to measure, determine, record everything, compute a response, communicate the event and even take basic action instantaneously.
        For every operation on a molecule - every addition, substitution, removal, oxidation, reduction, polymerisation, lysis, chealation and more... Biology can do it - very, very well. Advanced nanotechnology exists! Tiny proteins are able to modify, construct, destroy, mass-produce and forcibly or controlledly transport to a certain location. We still produce many chemicals as racemic mixtures because we cannot be selective of which isomer we produce, since we are just mixing reagents, yet a protein can recognise and bind a molecule based on its actual shape and characteristics in 3D.
          We want to convert Molecule X to Molecule Y. This is the final stage...
          Molecule X contains groups A, B, C and D.
          We simply add Reagent R to molecule X under certain conditions.
          Reagent R contains group G and will attack group A and join with it, forming our GA group.
          That is Molecule Y - GA, B, C and D.
          Groups A and D are chemically very similar, e.g. they are both -COOH groups. Sometimes, Reagent R will also react with group D, forming group GD.
          ...So we have four potential outcomes, and will likely recieve a mixture of all four molecules after performing this reaction:
            A   B   C   D   (Molecule X)
            GA  B   C   D   (Molecule Y - ONLY desired product)
            A   B   C  GD   (Contaminant 1)
            GA  B   C  GD   (Contaminant 2)
          
          
          
  
  Interest and knowledge of space travel, very excited for the future there.
